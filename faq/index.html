      <p><i><strong>What is a neuropsychological Evaluation?</strong></i></p>
        <ul><p>
        Neuropsychological assessment focuses on the measurement of cognition
        and behavior including examining the effects of any brain injury or
        neurological disorder (such as astroke, seizure disorder, multiple
        sclerosis or dementia) that a person may experience.&nbsp; A core part
        of neuropsychological assessment is the administration of tests for the
        formal assessment of cognitive functioning. &nbsp;Aspects of cognitive
        functioning that are assessed typically include orientation,
        new-learning/memory, intelligence, language, visual skills (such as
        perception and spatial organization) and executive-functioning (such as
        problem solving, abstract reasoning and sequencing). &nbsp;However,
        clinical neuropsychological assessment is more than this and also takes
        into account a person's psychological, personal, social and educational
        circumstances. &nbsp;Clinical evaluation helps us to understand the
        pattern of cognitive strengths as well as any difficulties a person may
        have and to aid decision making for use in a medical, rehabilitation, or
        home environment.</p>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <br />

      <p><i><strong>What is the purpose of having one?</strong></i></p>
      <ul><p>
        There are three broad goals of clinical neuropsychological assessment.
        &nbsp;First, diagnosis to determine the nature of the underlying
        problem. &nbsp;Second, to understand the nature of any brain injury or
        resulting cognitive problem and its impact on the individual as a means
        of devising a treatment program or offering advice as to an individual's
        ability to carry out a certain tasks such as fitness to drive, returning
        to work, or functioning in school. &nbsp;And last, assessments may be
        undertaken to measure change in functioning over time such as to
        determine the consequences of a surgical procedure or the impact of
        medication or cognitive/ behavioral therapy over time.</p>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <br />

        <p><i><strong>How long does it take?</strong></i></p>
        <ul><p>
        Anywhere from 3 to 6 hours, depending on the person's age and the
        referral question. &nbsp;The results will be available in about a week.
        &nbsp;You can discuss your results with your referring physician or
        return to see Dr. Most and she will go over them with you in detail.</p>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <br />

      <p><i><strong>Are the tests invasive?</strong></i></p>
        <ul><p>
        No. &nbsp;There are no needles or wires involved. &nbsp;All of the tests
        are performed at a table or on the computer.</p>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <br />

        <p><i><strong>Will insurance cover my neuropsychological exam?</strong></i></p>
        <ul><p>
        In most cases, yes. &nbsp;Your evaluation will be covered under the
        major medical portion of your insurance. &nbsp;Depending on your policy,
        some specific diagnoses and types of testing may not be covered.
        &nbsp;As a courtesy, your coverage and co-pay requirements&nbsp;will be
        verified and provided to you before your visit.</p>
